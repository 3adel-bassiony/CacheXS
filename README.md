# Usage

Once you have installed CacheXS, integrating it into your project is straightforward. Below are the basic steps to get you started:

First, import CacheXS into your JavaScript or TypeScript file:

```typescript
import CacheXS from 'cachexs'
```

Then create a new instance for CacheXS and pass the configuration to it:

```typescript
const cacheXS = new CacheXS({
	redisConfig: {
		host: 'localhost',

# Documentation

The CacheXS package comes with a comprehensive set of features designed to make cache in your application straightforward and efficient. This section provides an overview of its capabilities and guides on how to use them effectively.

-   ### Features Overview

    -   **Simple Cache Management**: Easily cache the data in Redis with simple functions.

-   ### Usage & Configuration

    -   #### **Installation**

        Refer to the [Installation](#installation) section for instructions on how to install CacheXS using various package managers.

    -   #### **Initializing the Library:**

        You can create a new instance of CacheXS and pass the configuration for it directly like this example below:

        ```typescript
        const cacheXS = new CacheXS({
        	redisConnection: ioredis,
        	namespace: 'myCache',
        	enableDebug: true,
        })
        ```

        Alternatively, you can split the creation of the new instance and the configuration, useful when split up into different modules for bootstrapping.

        ```typescript
        const cacheXS = new CacheXS()

        cacheXS.configure({
        	redisConnection: ioredis,
        	namespace: 'myCache',
        	enableDebug: true,
        })
        ```

-   ### Methods/Properties

    -   `get` Retrieves the value associated with the specified key from the cache.

        ```typescript
        const stringValue = await cacheXS.get<string>('myKey') // -> myValue
        const stringValue = await cacheXS.get<number>('myKey') // -> 123
        const objectValue = await cacheXS.get<MyObject>('myKey') // -> { name: 'John', age: 30 }
        ```

    -   `set`: Sets a value in the cache.

        ```typescript
        await cacheXS.set('myKey', 'myValue')
        await cacheXS.set('myKey', 123)
        await cacheXS.set('myKey', { name: 'John', age: 30 }, { expiresIn: 360 })
        ```

    -   `setForever` Sets a value in the cache forever

        ```typescript
        await cacheXS.setForever('user', { name: 'John Doe', age: 30 })
        ```

    -   `getOrSet` Retrieves the value associated with the specified key from the cache. If the value does not exist, it sets the value to the provided fallback value and returns it.

        ```typescript
        const username = await cacheXS.getOrSet('myKey', 'myValue')
        ```

    -   `getOrSetForever` Retrieves the value associated with the specified key from the cache. If the value does not exist, it sets the specified fallback value in the cache and returns it.

        ```typescript
        value = await cacheXS.getOrSetForever('myKey', 'defaultValue')
        ```

    -   `delete` Deletes a cache entry by its key.

        ```typescript
        await cacheXS.delete('myKey')
        ```

    -   `deleteMany` Deletes multiple cache entries specified by the given keys.

        ```typescript
        await cacheXS.deleteMany(['myKey', 'myKey2', 'myKey3'])
        ```

    -   `clear` Clears all cache entries in the CacheXS instance.

        ```typescript
        await cacheXS.clear()
        ```

    -   `has` Checks if a key exists in the cache.

        ```typescript
        await cacheXS.has('myKey') // -> True || False
        ```

    -   `missing` Checks if a key is missing in the cache.

        ```typescript
        await cacheXS.missing('myKey') // -> True || False
        ```

    -   `concatenateKey` Concatenates the given key with the namespace and returns the resulting string.

        ```typescript
        await cacheXS.concatenateKey('myKey') // -> 'CacheXS:myKey'
        ```

    -   `redisConnection` Gets the Redis connection.

        ```typescript
        cacheXS.redisConnection // -> ioredis instance
        ```

    -   `redisUrl` Gets the Redis URL.

        ```typescript
        cacheXS.redisUrl // -> 'redis://user:pass@localhost:6379'

        ```typescript
        cacheXS.redisConfig // -> { host: 'localhost', port: 6379, password: '' }
        ```

    -   `expiresIn` Gets the expiration time in seconds.

        ```typescript
        cacheXS.expiresIn // -> 60
        ```

    -   `namespace` Gets the namespace of the cache.

        ```typescript
        cacheXS.namespace // -> 'CacheXS
        ```

    -   `isDebugEnabled` Gets a value indicating whether debug mode is enabled.

        ```typescript
        cacheXS.isDebugEnabled // -> True || False
